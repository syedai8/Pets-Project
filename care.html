                <h2>Tips:</h2>
                <ol class="tips-list">
                    <li>Prepare a Safe, Quiet Space: Set up a small, secure room with food, water, a litter box, scratching post, toys, and a cozy bed. This gives the cat a calm place to decompress.</li>
                    <li>Cat-proof Your Home: Remove toxic plants, secure cords, hide small objects, and ensure windows and balconies are safe.</li>
                    <li>Stock Up on Essentials: Food (preferably what the cat is already eating), litter, bowls, a carrier, grooming tools, and a scratching surface.</li>
                    <li>Give Them Time to Adjust: Cats may hide, avoid contact, or be shy at first. Let them come to you on their own terms.</li>
                    <li>Keep a Routine: Offer meals, play, and quiet time at consistent hours. Stability helps them feel secure.</li>
                    <li>Introduce Slowly: If you have other pets, introduce them gradually, scent swapping first, then visual meetings, then brief supervised encounters.</li>
                    <li>Use Positive Reinforcement: Treats, gentle play, and soft interactions help build trust.</li>
                    <li>Respect Their Boundaries: Learn their communication cues such as tail, ears, and posture say a lot.</li>
                    <li>Provide Enrichment: Offer puzzle feeders, climbing spaces, window perches, and regular play to keep them mentally and physically stimulated.</li>
                    <li>Schedule a Vet Visit: Even if the cat was recently checked, a vet introduction is helpful to establish care and update vaccines or microchip info.</li>
                    <li>Maintain Proper Identification: Microchip information should be updated with your details and consider a breakaway collar with a tag.</li>
                    <li>Keep Up With Grooming & Preventatives: Brushing, nail trimming, and flea/tick/parasite prevention keep your cat healthy and comfortable.</li>
                    <li>Understand That Every Cat Is Different: Personalities range from outgoing to reserved so let them blossom at their own pace.</li>
                    <li>Be Patient With Setbacks: Accidents or anxious behavior can happen during transitions but avoid punishment and focus on positive solutions.</li>
                    <li>Celebrate the Wins: Notice and enjoy small signs of trust—slow blinks, gentle head-butts, or choosing to sit near you.</li>
